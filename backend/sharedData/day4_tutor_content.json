There are two main types: 'for loops' which repeat a set number of times, and 'while loops' which keep repeating as long as a condition is true. This makes your code more efficient and easier to maintain.",

Functions can take inputs (called parameters) and return outputs (called return values). They help organize your code and avoid repetition.",

The most common conditional is the 'if statement', which runs certain code only if a condition is met. You can also use 'else' for what happens when the condition is false, and 'elif' (else if) for multiple conditions.",
